unoconv converts any document format that OpenOffice can import, to any
document format that OpenOffice can export.

unoconv uses the OpenOffice's UNO bindings for non-interactive conversion
of documents.

Before using unoconv you need to start an OpenOffice instance that listens
on a specific port by doing:

    ooffice -headless "-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;"
