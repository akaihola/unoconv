= Running unoconv in headless mode =

Since OpenOffice 2.3 you do not need an X display for starting ooffice.
However you may need the openoffice.org-headless package from your
distribution. Since OpenOffice 2.4 nothing special is needed, running
in headless mode does not require X.

For any older OpenOffice releases, remember that ooffice requires an X
display, even when using it in headless mode. One solution is to use Xvfb
to create a headless X display for ooffice.
