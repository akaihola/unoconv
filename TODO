### Disclaimer
This is my TODO list. If you're interested in one of these features, there
are 3 options. Either wait for someone to implement it, sponsor someone
to implement it or implement it yourself.

If you want to implement something, please contact me first so that we can
discuss acceptable implementations. In some cases I haven't thought about
it too deeply, but for others I know exactly what I require.

If you have other nice ideas that you think would be an improvement, please
contact me as well. :) Send an email to: Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>

### Usability
- Maybe change the commandline interface to reflect ImageMagick's convert
- Add the list of input formats as well, and print that list too

### OpenOffice execution
- If an openoffice exists, -accept modifies the existing behaviour of
  the running instance. In that case we need to -unaccept afterwards
  (and not try to kill a ghost)
- If a unoconv-listener has been started, and you start an openoffice
  gui, the openoffice gui runs as the same process as the listeners.
  In that case we need to -unaccept afterwards (and not kill the gui)
