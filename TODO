### Disclaimer
This is my TODO list. If you're interested in one of these features, there
are 3 options. Either wait for someone to implement it, sponsor someone
to implement it or implement it yourself.

If you want to implement something, please contact me first so that we can
discuss acceptable implementations. In some cases I haven't thought about
it too deeply, but for others I know exactly what I require.

If you have other nice ideas that you think would be an improvement, please
contact me as well. :) Send an email to: Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>

### Usability
- Maybe change the commandline interface to reflect ImageMagick's convert
- Add the list of input formats as well, and print that list too
- Preserve the original timestamp, ownership and permissions
- Translate UnoExceptions into a clear explanation (like Exception 2074 or 3088 ?)

### Features
- Change/force the document size during conversion
- Change/force the document encoding during conversion (UTF-8)

### Known bugs
- On some systems loading OpenOffice is slow and this could lead to random errors
